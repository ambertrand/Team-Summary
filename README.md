## Developer Notes:
For this project I was tasked with developing a software engineering team page that was created after the user answered questions in the CLI.

For this project I felt I had a good grasp of ES6 classes and was able to get the test passed fairly easily.  However once I got to the app.js part I struggled to figure out how to get the page to render and re-prompt the user to continue the questions or write the file.  After some help from classmates I was able to get the MVP working the way I wanted.
